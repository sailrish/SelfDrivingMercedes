DriveServer.py  -  Self-Driving Mercedes: web server front end

A small FastAPI server that drives the car over HTTP, built on the same
car_control library as the DriveCar.py CLI.

Unlike the CLI, the server connects to the BuWizz at startup and keeps that
connection open, so the steering center is found once per connection rather
than before every run. The connection can be closed and reopened with
/disconnect and /connect; while there is no connection (including after an
unexpected drop), /run and /recenter are refused.

Setup / run:
    python3 -m pip install fastapi uvicorn bleak
    python3 DriveServer.py                        # listen on 0.0.0.0:8000
    python3 DriveServer.py --port 8080

Endpoints:
    POST /run                       start a mission with the default duration
    POST /run  {"duration": 60}     same as `DriveCar.py --duration 60`
    POST /recenter                  re-find the steering center now
    POST /connect                   connect to the BuWizz and home the steering
    POST /disconnect                close the BuWizz connection

/run replies 202 straight away and the mission runs in the background; its
progress is printed to this server's console, as with the CLI. The others wait
for their work to finish. Every endpoint replies 409 while the car is busy
(there is only one car), and /run and /recenter reply 409 when not connected.

While idle the server keeps feeding the BuWizz watchdog, which otherwise trips
a few seconds after the last command and drops the BLE connection. Only the
watchdog is fed -- no motor commands -- so the car still stops if this process
dies. Console output is timestamped.
